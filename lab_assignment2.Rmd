I found the database of all the last words for texas's death row from 1980 to today. My question is how positive or negative are most people's last words?

6 months after graduation I would like to be either working or in grad school. The ideal would be that I would move out of colorado and experience other parts of the country. I would want to be some sort of programmer or data person ideally. After 5 years I would want to work at company that is a chill place to work. 

I don't know what my greatest career achievement would be because I don't really know what I want to do career-wise. 

I want to learn R, of course, and how to work with data to make conclusions. I also want to gain the skills I would need to get an internship to work with data to see if that's what I want to do career-wise.

Miscellaneous stuff about me: I work for the environmental center on the eco-social justice team  and as an applied math learning assistant which are both jobs that I love. I also play the violin in the campus orchestra. 

ok
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Question 1: How can we best condense large scaled data to eliminate outliers? 
Question 2: In six months I am eager to be in Africa with the peace corps teaching math to middle and high schoolers. In five years, I want to be in graduate school studying something that I am passionate about. 
Question 3: I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be one that I will never see or that I have made an enormous impact on someone. I am hoping to pursue a field that allows me to help and work with others. 

I used to be in the circus as a child!
