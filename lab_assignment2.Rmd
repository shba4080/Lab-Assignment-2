About Me

Shreeya Basrur

I found the database of all the last words for texas's death row from 1980 to today. My question is how positive or negative are most people's last words?

6 months after graduation I would like to be either working or in grad school. The ideal would be that I would move out of colorado and experience other parts of the country. I would want to be some sort of programmer or data person ideally. After 5 years I would want to work at company that is a chill place to work. 

I don't know what my greatest career achievement would be because I don't really know what I want to do career-wise. 

I want to learn R, of course, and how to work with data to make conclusions. I also want to gain the skills I would need to get an internship to work with data to see if that's what I want to do career-wise.

Miscellaneous stuff about me: I work for the environmental center on the eco-social justice team  and as an applied math learning assistant which are both jobs that I love. I also play the violin in the campus orchestra. 

Feedback: 
Kelsey: I loved how thorough and long your answers were. You really went into details. I don't really have anything negative or constructive to add. 
James: Your section is very clear and specific especially with the non-statistic realated problem. I don't think you really need to change anything but if you wanted, you could number the questions. You could also give an example for the career achievement question even if it is general.
Matthew: The question was very dark and intersting to think about, and everything else is great but maybe number the questions to make it look a little more orginized.

I would like to know how effective tutoring truly is because there is a lot of bias involved.
 
6 months after graduation I would like to get a job analyzing big data and creating algorithms to based on that analysis.
 
I'm not exactly sure what I hope my greatest career achievement would be but most likely helping to make some sort of process related to the tech industry more efficient and or affect.
 
I would like to get a solid base of statistics and R knowledge that would help me analyze data.
 
Miscellaneous stuff about me: I am a big european sports fan and support the Glasgow Celtic, which is my dad's hometown team growing up.

Feedback: 
Shreeya: You could number your questions to be more clear so Dr. Vance can grade easier. 
Kelsey: I think your intentions for this class are good. I think numbering the questions would help organize it also!
Matthew: intersting question and its pretty cool that your set on the whole statistical data career, but numering the questions would make it a little orginized.

Question 1: How can we best condense large scaled data to eliminate outliers? 
Question 2: In six months I am eager to be in Africa with the peace corps teaching math to middle and high schoolers. In five years, I want to be in graduate school studying something that I am passionate about. 
Question 3: I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be one that I will never see or that I have made an enormous impact on someone. I am hoping to pursue a field that allows me to help and work with others. 

I used to be in the circus as a child!

Feedback:
Shreeya: You could elaborate more about your fun fact so we can learn more about you. For example, what did you do in the circus?
James: Your section is very clear and its really cool you were in the circus as a child. I like how you numbered the questions so it is obvious what question you are answering. You could add a more specific or less statistics related problem for the first question because it is supposed to be a non-statistics question.
Matthew: Great set-up, its clear which question is which.

Q1: What really came first the Chicken or the egg?
Q2: Six months after graduating I wish to be going back to Alaska to discover what I want to do. Then after five years hopefully I find a job that I enjoy doing and can make a living.
Q3: I hope my greatest career accomplishment would to make enough to afford to have lion statues at the beginning of my driveway, because then I would know I made it. And through this course I hope to learn key skills to make me stand out in the workforce. 
-In Moab, Utah I almost died going 4x4 driving in the canyon. 
Feedback:
Shreeya: I think you could also elaborate on your fun fact so we can learn more about you. I want to hear more of this story. 
Kelsey: I think your first question is funny! I can't believe you almost died. Your work looks good and I enjoyed learning about you.
James: Your section is very clear and I like how you numbered the questions so it is obvious what question you are answering. I don't think you need to change anything your answers all work and are very specific.
