Question 1: How can we best condense large scaled data to eliminate outliers? 
Question 2: In six months I am eager to be in Africa with the peace corps teaching math to middle and high schoolers. In five years, I want to be in graduate school studying something that I am passionate about. 
Question 3: I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be one that I will never see or that I have made an enormous impact on someone. I am hoping to pursue a field that allows me to help and work with others. 

I used to be in the circus as a child!
